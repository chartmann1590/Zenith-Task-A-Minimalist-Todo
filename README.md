## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine (for frontend)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine (for backend)
- SMTP email account (Gmail recommended)

## üê≥ Docker Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker. This will automatically handle all dependencies and setup:

```bash
# Run the automated Docker setup script
./docker-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your operating system
- Install Docker if not present
- Set up the complete application environment
- Start all services automatically

**Application URLs after setup:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](./DOCKER_SETUP.md).

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start the application
docker compose up -d

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Test the setup
./test-docker-setup.sh
```

2. **Start both frontend and backend:**
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

This will automatically:
