# Zenith Task: A Minimalist Todo Platform with Email Reminders

Zenith Task is a visually stunning, minimalist, and highly interactive todo list application designed to enhance productivity through an elegant and intuitive user experience. The application features a clean two-column layout: a sidebar for project navigation and a main content area for managing tasks.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine (for frontend)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine (for backend)
- SMTP email account (Gmail recommended)

## üê≥ Docker Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker. This will automatically handle all dependencies and setup:

```bash
# Run the automated Docker setup script
./docker-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Detect your operating system
- Install Docker if not present
- **Interactively configure environment variables** (SMTP settings, email configuration)
- Set up the complete application environment
- Start all services automatically

**Application URLs after setup:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

### üåê Remote Access
The application supports remote access from other devices on your network:
- **LAN Access**: `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
- **Mobile Devices**: Works perfectly on smartphones and tablets
- **Cross-Origin**: Automatic CORS configuration for network access

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](./docs/DOCKER_SETUP.md). For complete documentation, see [Documentation Index](./docs/README.md).

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start the application
docker compose up -d

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Test the setup
./test-docker-setup.sh
```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chartmann1590/Zenith-Task-A-Minimalist-Todo.git
   cd zenith-task
   ```

2. **Start both frontend and backend:**
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

This will automatically:
- Install backend dependencies
- Start the backend server on port 3001
- Start the frontend development server on port 3000
- Open the application in your browser

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Set up backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your SMTP settings
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start frontend:**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

### Email Configuration

1. **Gmail Setup (Recommended):**
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
   - Generate an App Password: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Use the App Password in your backend `.env` file

2. **Configure SMTP in the app:**
   - Go to Settings page
   - Enter your SMTP details
   - Test the connection
   - Send a test email

## Development

The application consists of two parts:

- **Frontend**: React app running on `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend**: Node.js API server running on `http://localhost:3001`

## üìã Usage Guide

### Project Management
- **Create Projects**: Click the "+" button in the sidebar to add new projects
- **Rename Projects**: Right-click on any project and select "Rename"
- **Delete Projects**: Right-click on any project (except Inbox) and select "Delete Project"
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Deleting a project permanently removes all associated tasks
  - Projects are deleted from the database with cascade deletion of all tasks

### Task Management
- **Add Tasks**: Use the task input field in any project
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder tasks by dragging them up or down
- **Task Details**: Set priority levels (low, medium, high) and due dates
- **Edit Tasks**: Click on any task to edit its title inline
- **Delete Tasks**: Use the task context menu or delete button

### Email Reminders
- **Setup**: Configure SMTP settings in the Settings page
- **Enable**: Set reminder times on individual tasks
- **Automation**: Backend automatically sends emails at specified times
- **Templates**: Beautiful HTML email templates with task details and priorities

### Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application, including pages, components, and the Zustand store.
-   `shared/`: Contains shared TypeScript types used by the application to ensure type safety.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Production Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d --build

# The application will be available at:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Backend API: http://localhost:3001
```

### Static Hosting Deployment
For frontend-only deployment to static hosting platforms:

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to your preferred platform:**
    Deploy the built files from the `dist` directory to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

**Note**: For full functionality including email reminders and data persistence, you'll need to deploy both frontend and backend with database support.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Remote Access Issues**
```bash
# If you get CORS errors when accessing from another device:
# The app automatically allows network origins, but if issues persist:

# Check your firewall settings
# Ensure ports 3000 and 3001 are accessible on your network
# Try accessing with your actual IP instead of localhost
```

**2. Docker Issues**
```bash
# If containers fail to start:
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate

# Check container logs:
docker compose logs -f
```

**3. Email Reminders Not Working**
- Verify SMTP settings in the Settings page
- Test the connection using the "Test Connection" button
- For Gmail: Use App Passwords, not your regular password
- Check that the backend server is running (port 3001)

**4. JavaScript Module Errors**
- The app includes crypto.randomUUID fallback for HTTP contexts
- If you see module loading errors, try refreshing the page
- Ensure you're accessing the correct URL (localhost:3000)
