# Security Fixes and Docker Configuration

## XSS Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Backend Email Template Sanitization
**File:** `backend/server.js`
**Issue:** User input (task title, dates, priority) was directly inserted into HTML email templates without sanitization.

**Fix:**
- Added `sanitizeHtml()` function to remove dangerous HTML tags and attributes
- Added `escapeHtml()` function to escape HTML entities
- All user input is now properly escaped before being inserted into email templates
- Email templates are sanitized before being sent

### 2. Frontend Chart Component Sanitization
**File:** `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`
**Issue:** Color values could potentially contain malicious content when injected into CSS.

**Fix:**
- Added sanitization for color values using regex to remove dangerous characters
- Moved CSS generation to a separate function for better control
- Color values are now sanitized before being used in CSS

### 3. Frontend Sanitization Utilities
**File:** `src/lib/sanitize.ts`
**Added:** Comprehensive sanitization utilities using DOMPurify for client-side and custom sanitization for server-side.

**Features:**
- `sanitizeHtml()` - Removes dangerous HTML tags and attributes
- `escapeHtml()` - Escapes HTML entities
- `sanitizeUserInput()` - Combines both for React components
- Uses DOMPurify for client-side sanitization
- Custom regex-based sanitization for server-side

## Docker Configuration Fixes

### 1. Nginx Configuration
**File:** `Dockerfile.frontend`
**Issue:** Nginx configuration was not properly set up, causing "host not found" errors.

**Fix:**
- Added proper nginx.conf creation in Dockerfile
- Ensured nginx includes the custom configuration
- Added wget for health checks

### 2. Service Dependencies
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`
**Issue:** Frontend was starting before backend was ready.

**Fix:**
- Added health check dependency: `depends_on: backend: condition: service_healthy`
- Added health checks for both frontend and backend services
- Backend must be healthy before frontend starts

### 3. Network Configuration
**Files:** `nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`
**Issue:** Services were not properly communicating within Docker network.

**Fix:**
- Verified nginx proxy configuration points to correct backend service
- Ensured both services are on the same Docker network
- Added proper proxy headers for request forwarding

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **XSS Prevention:**
   - Try entering HTML/JavaScript in task titles
   - Verify content is properly escaped in email templates
   - Check that malicious content is sanitized

2. **Docker Setup:**
   - Run `./test-docker-setup.sh` to test the complete setup
   - Verify all services start and communicate properly
   - Test API endpoints through nginx proxy

### Security Verification
- All user input is now properly sanitized before DOM insertion
- Email templates are safe from XSS attacks
- Chart components sanitize color values
- No `innerHTML` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized user input

## Files Modified

### Security Fixes:
- `backend/server.js` - Added HTML sanitization for email templates
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` - Added color value sanitization
- `src/lib/sanitize.ts` - New sanitization utilities
- `package.json` - Added DOMPurify dependency

### Docker Fixes:
- `Dockerfile.frontend` - Fixed nginx configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added health checks and dependencies
- `nginx.conf` - Verified proxy configuration
- `test-docker-setup.sh` - Added comprehensive test script

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "dompurify": "^3.0.8",
  "@types/dompurify": "^3.0.5"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify everything works:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker-setup.sh
   ```

2. Test XSS prevention by trying to inject malicious content

3. Verify all API endpoints work through the nginx proxy

4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

The application is now secure against XSS attacks and properly configured for Docker deployment.
