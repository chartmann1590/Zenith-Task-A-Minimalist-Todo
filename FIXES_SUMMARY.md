# Fixes Applied

## 1. ESLint Error Fix

**File:** `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` (line 91)
**Issue:** Unnecessary escape character in regex
**Fix:** Removed unnecessary backslash before double quote

```tsx
// Before (ESLint error):
const safeColor = color ? color.replace(/[<>\"'&]/g, '') : null

// After (fixed):
const safeColor = color ? color.replace(/[<>"'&]/g, '') : null
```

## 2. Docker Networking Fix

### Problem
The nginx container was failing with "host not found in upstream 'backend'" because:
- Backend service wasn't ready when nginx started
- No proper health checks or startup dependencies
- No graceful error handling for backend unavailability

### Solutions Applied

#### A. Improved Nginx Configuration (`nginx.conf`)
- Added better error handling for backend unavailability
- Added proxy timeouts and retry logic
- Added fallback response when backend is unavailable

#### B. Enhanced Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)
- Added proper health checks for both services
- Backend must be healthy before frontend starts
- Improved health check intervals and timeouts
- Added wget to both containers for health checks

#### C. Backend Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile`)
- Added wget installation for health checks
- Improved health check reliability

#### D. Frontend Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.frontend`)
- Added startup script that waits for backend
- Added wget installation
- Nginx only starts after backend is ready

#### E. Startup Script (`start-nginx.sh`)
- Waits for backend to be ready before starting nginx
- Prevents nginx from starting with unresolved upstream

#### F. Enhanced Test Script (`test-docker-setup.sh`)
- Better waiting logic for service readiness
- Comprehensive debugging information
- Network and container status reporting

## 3. Key Improvements

### Health Checks
- Backend: Checks `/api/health` endpoint every 10s
- Frontend: Checks nginx availability every 15s
- Proper startup dependencies ensure correct order

### Error Handling
- Nginx gracefully handles backend unavailability
- Returns proper JSON error responses
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Network Reliability
- Services wait for each other to be ready
- Proper Docker network configuration
- Retry logic for failed connections

## 4. Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
./test-docker-setup.sh
```

The script will:
1. Build and start all containers
2. Wait for services to be ready
3. Test all endpoints
4. Provide debugging information if issues occur

## 5. Files Modified

- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx` - Fixed ESLint error
- `nginx.conf` - Enhanced error handling
- `docker-compose.yml` - Improved health checks and dependencies
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Added wget for health checks
- `Dockerfile.frontend` - Added startup script and wget
- `start-nginx.sh` - New startup script
- `test-docker-setup.sh` - Enhanced testing and debugging

## 6. Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ ESLint errors are resolved
- ✅ Docker containers start in correct order
- ✅ Backend is ready before nginx starts
- ✅ API proxy works correctly
- ✅ Graceful error handling for backend unavailability
- ✅ Comprehensive health checks and monitoring
